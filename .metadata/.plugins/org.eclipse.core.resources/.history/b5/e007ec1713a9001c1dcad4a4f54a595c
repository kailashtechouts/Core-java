/*Class named Operations have final variables like plus,minus,divide and multiply.
    This class has a method named calculate which takes 2 inputs of type double and return value in double
    inside calculate: if plus, inputs are added and returned.(similarly for other methods minus,divide and multiply).
    AssertionError is also thrown when user doesn't perform any of these operations in default.
    In your main method: calculate all 4 results and have these printed in console.
    Make sure to have dynamic inputs.*/
